## Reflection Document
### HTML

#### 01-html file: 

For this file, I was able to complete the code on my own and I also used the videos to check if my solution was correct. The material I had to go over was helpful, especially the how to create a form exercise. Since this is the first lab note I have no questions since it is direct. Before taking this course, I watched an one hour video explaining a little bit about HTML and CSS so I was familiar to this.  

#### 02-a11y file: 

For this file, we had to create a fillable form, I used the videos provided to help me code. In this file, I learned about the difference between explicit labeling and implicit labeling. I thought maybe there was exercise regarding this topic for us to be more familiar with different types of labeling. 

#### 03-css file: 

I definitely used the videos to complete this file. Everything in this file was new to me so it was very helpful. The layout amd mav bar page was the most interesting to me. I wished the selector file was more detailed, I had a bit of trouble selecting different element. 

#### 04-flexbox file:

I watched the solution video to be able to complete this exercise. I also used additional materials such as youtube to get a better understanding of flexbox. I had fun this learning to style these box. Currently, I have no questions regarding this material. 

#### 05-css-grid file:

In this file, I used the videos provided to complete each tasks. I think I like the css grid areas more than the flexbox. I thought this exercise was very helpful as I used it for help in the hw. I thought the explanations in the videos was very clear to follow and understand. 

#### 06-bootstrap file: 

For this file, I attempted to code myself. In the end, I directed towards the videos for more help. The videos were extremely helpful especially the cards and modal for the Homework. I wished there was more detailed regarding the styles for the cards section. 

#### 07-javascript file:

I definitetly used the videos to help me code this file, I am new roo Js so I was a bit difficult for me to follow and understand. I plan to do more research and look over the slide for more information especially for fetching. I wished there was more lectures regarding the topic! 

#### 08-jquery file:

For this file, I have no idea I was to code since I was bit for the week. I was/am behind on a few lecture. The video had helped me very much but for me, I thought it went a little too fast for me. Moreover, the ajax file really aided me in HW! I wish there was some video lectures oon the background that dives more in depth of this topic! On my side, I will need to do more research and goo over the lecture slides to better understanding. 

### Accessibility

Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible

#### 01-html file: 

There was little to no accessibility for this file since user can only view what is coded and are not able to input or store information.

#### 02-a11y file: 

In this file, users are able to input their name and email and click on the radio button. The website checks for if the user input the email is correct, if not, it tells the user to re-input after submitting. The form is not useable since the information is not stored or direct anywhere. 

#### 03-css file: 

For this file, 
The user can only view each website. It is also not accessible to users who can't see. Lighthouse accessibility extension showed error 

#### 04-flexbox file: 

This file wasn't about user accessibility it is about formatting the layout of the website so the accessibility for users is none. 

#### 05-css-grid file: 

This file wasn't about user accessibility it is about formatting the layout of the website so the accessibility for users is none. 

#### 06-bootstrap file:

The accessibility for this file is none as it is also just a styling page and practice. 

#### 07-javascript file: 

The accessibility here is good, for the last exercises of this file. I passed the accessibility check with LightHouse and Wave! I thought the styles were great as well 

#### 08-jquery file: 

The accessibility has passed the accessibility check with LightHouse and Wave
